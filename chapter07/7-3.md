# 7.3 标准端口

本节中描述的过程返回连接到进程的 stdin, stdout, stderr 的端口。第一个集合返回“现成”的文本端口（可能包含与实现相关的 transcoders, 及缓冲模式）; 第二组过程创建新的二进制端口，可以用于二进制输入/输出，or with the help of `transcoded-port`, for textual input/output with program-supplied transcoders and buffer modes.

```
procedure: (current-input-port) 
returns: the current input port 
procedure: (current-output-port) 
returns: the current output port 
procedure: (current-error-port) 
returns: the current error port 
libraries: (rnrs io ports), (rnrs io simple), (rnrs)
```

The current-input, current-output, and current-error ports return pre-built textual ports that are initially associated with a process's standard input, standard output, and standard error streams.

The values returned by current-input-port and current-output-port can be altered temporarily by the convenience I/O procedures with-input-from-file and with-output-to-file ([Section 7.9](7-9.md)).

```
procedure: (standard-input-port) 
returns: a fresh binary input port connected to the standard input stream 
procedure: (standard-output-port) 
returns: a fresh binary output port connected to the standard output stream 
procedure: (standard-error-port) 
returns: a fresh binary output port connected to the standard error stream 
libraries: (rnrs io ports), (rnrs)
```

Because ports may be buffered, confusion can result if operations on more than one port attached to one of a process's standard streams are interleaved. Thus, these procedures are typically appropriate only when a program no longer needs to use any existing ports attached to the standard streams.
