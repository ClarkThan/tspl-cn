# 1.2 Scheme命名约定

Scheme's naming conventions are designed to provide a high degree of regularity. The following is a list of these naming conventions:

+ Predicate names end in a question mark ( ? ). Predicates are procedures that return a true or false answer, such as `eq?`, `zero?`, and `string=?`. The common numeric comparators `=, <, >, <=, >=` are exceptions to this naming convention.

+ Type predicates, such as `pair?`, are created from the name of the type, in this case pair, and the question mark.

+ The names of most character, string, and vector procedures start with the prefix `char-`, `string-`, and `vector-`, e.g., `string-append`. (The names of some list procedures start with `list-`, but most do not.)

+ The names of procedures that convert an object of one type into an object of another type are written as *type1->type2*, e.g., `vector->list`.

+ The names of procedures and syntactic forms that cause side effects end with an exclamation point ( ! ). These include `set!` and `vector-set!`. Procedures that perform input or output technically cause side effects, but their names are exceptions to this rule.

Programmers should employ these same conventions in their own code whenever possible.
